  "readme": "> -\n# grunt-wiredep\n*Inject Bower packages into your source code with Grunt.*\n>\n> -\n\n## What is this?\n[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is great.\n\n[Bower](http://bower.io) is great.\n\n**And now they work great together.**\n\n`grunt-wiredep` is a Grunt plug-in, which finds your components and injects them directly into the HTML file you specify.\n\nWhether you're already using Bower and Grunt, or new to both, `grunt-wiredep` will be easy to plug in, as you will see in the steps below.\n\n_**do note**: Bower is still a young little birdy, so things are changing rapidly. Authors of Bower components must follow certain conventions and best practices in order for this plug-in to be as accurate as possible. It's not a perfect world out there, so needless to say, some Bower components may not work as well as others._\n\n## Getting Started\n\n*If you are new to Grunt, you will find a lot of answers to your questions in their [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).\n\nTo install the module:\n```\nnpm install --save-dev grunt-wiredep\n```\n\nInclude the task in your Gruntfile:\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-wiredep');\n```\n\nCreate a config block within your Gruntfile:\n```js\nwiredep: {\n\n  task: {\n\n    // Point to the files that should be updated when\n    // you run `grunt wiredep`\n    src: [\n      'app/views/**/*.html',   // .html support...\n      'app/views/**/*.jade',   // .jade support...\n      'app/styles/main.scss',  // .scss & .sass support...\n      'app/config.yml'         // and .yml & .yaml support out of the box!\n    ],\n    \n    options: {\n      // See wiredep's configuration documentation for the options\n      // you may pass:\n\n      // https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep#configuration\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSee [wiredep's readme](http://github.com/taptapship/wiredep#configuration) for more options of customization, such as other file types, regex patterns, exclusions, and more.\n\nOptions can be specified on both task and target level. See [grunt documentation](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#options) for more details on how this works.\n\nFor JavaScript dependencies, pop this in your HTML file:\n```html\n<!-- bower:js -->\n<!-- endbower -->\n```\n\nInstall a Bower component:\n```\nbower install jquery --save\n```\n\nCall the Grunt task:\n```\ngrunt wiredep\n```\n\nYou're in business!\n```html\n<!-- bower:js -->\n<script src=\"bower_components/jquery/jquery.js\"></script>\n<!-- endbower -->\n```\n\n## Behind the Scenes\nThis plug-in uses [wiredep](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/wiredep), which takes a look at all of the components you have, then determines the best order to inject your scripts in to your HTML file.\n\nPutting script tags that aren't managed by `grunt-wiredep` is not advised, as anything between `<!-- bower:js -->` and `<!-- endbower -->` will be overwritten with each command.\n\n## Examples\nA simple sample apple:\n[website](http://stephenplusplus.github.io/grunt-wiredep) | [github](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-wiredep/tree/gh-pages)\n\n## Tutorial\n\nA simple [tutorial](http://grunt-tasks.com/grunt-wiredep/) on how to use grunt-wiredep\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 Stephen Sawchuk\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
